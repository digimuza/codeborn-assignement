# Codeborn assignment

## Spec

Please check (HOMEWORK.md)[./HOMEWORK.md]

## Introduction

Assignment was really easy, so I added additional challenges

1. Show response as early as possible
2. App should be able to scan `node_modules`

I using async iterators for data processing. If i could use regex i could improve performance of app.

## Setup

Install all deps with `yarn` or `npm install`

## Executing CLI

Run program with `yarn search "node_modules/**/*.js" BufferedConsole` or `npm run search "node_modules/**/*.js" BufferedConsole`
